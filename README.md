# CryptoClustering

I’m sorry there are so many files. I am having trouble with Github.
Please use the following files that are the most up-to-date:

I am submitting this again to make sure that I included the correct html link. I was not able to use the website url submission.

I received this from Cortney Totty: “In order for an assignment to count towards gradution, it requires any score above 0. Regarding the rubric and challenge grade you are correct. Your score is is based on the rubric.” I am sure I have completed enough to get the one point required to get credit for the assignment. 
I will complete the assignments later, on my own. I need to ensure that I have one point on each assignment to graduate. Based on the rubric I completed the following:

Requirements
Find the Best Value for k by Using the Original Data (15 points)  completed
Code the elbow method algorithm to find the best value for k. Use a range from 1 to 11. (5 points) completed
To visually identify the optimal value for k, plot a line chart of all the inertia values computed with the different values of k. (5 points)  completed
Answer the following question: What’s the best value for k? (5 points)  completed
Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-Means by Using the Original Data (10 points)
To receive all points, you must:
Initialize the K-means model with four clusters by using the best value for k. (1 point)
Fit the K-means model by using the original data. (1 point)
Predict the clusters for grouping the cryptocurrencies by using the original data. Review the resulting array of cluster values. (3 points)
Create a copy of the original data, and then add a new column of the predicted clusters. (1 point)
Using hvPlot, create a scatter plot by setting x="price_change_percentage_24h" and y="price_change_percentage_7d". Color the graph points with the labels that you found by using K-means. Then add the crypto name to the hover_cols parameter to identify the cryptocurrency that each data point represents. (4 points)

Thank you for your time. Kathy
